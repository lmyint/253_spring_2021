# Schedule {-}

The schedule below is a tentative outline of our plans for the module.

**Before each class period, please watch the indicated videos and check on your understanding by actively reviewing the associated [Learning Objectives](learning-objectives.html).** The readings listed below are optional but serve as a nice complement to the videos and class activities. Readings refer to chapters/sections in the Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR) textbook (available online [here](https://www.statlearning.com/s/ISLR-Seventh-Printing-xwa7.pdf)).
